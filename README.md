# rock-paper-scissors

My first JavaScript project. It's plain and simple with not much interactivity and style because the focus was mainly on practicing basic javascript concepts like variables, strings, functions, conditionals, logical operators etc...

Challenging part of this project was:

- writing the algorithm for winning/losing condition with minimum code (wanted to keep it simple).

What I learned:

- became more comfortable to work with functions, function scope, how return and call work.
- better understanding of conditionals (if...else), and logical operators (&& (AND), || (OR), ! (NOt))

- The most beneficial lesson was to learn about how to approach a problem and how to solve it.

        Method that helped me a lot was to:
        1. first understand the task/problem. Explain it. (e.g. what is rock-paper-scissor? how it works? what are the rules? (not in code but in plain english(any language you prefer)))

        2. A general overview of your goal. (e.g. an interactive program where the user inputs their choice and then that input/choice is compared with another input/choice by computer. where will the result it be shown? etc)

        3. Dividing the problem into smaller ones. (e.g a function for getting the user's input, another function for generating computer's choice, and so on...)

        4. Start writing pseudocode for each chunck of your problem using simple language and some variable name, type etc.

        5. Finally, Convert your pseudocode into code. Google the syntax and/or errors if/when needed. Check and verify if it's the desired result. Move on to the next bit and repeat the same.

        6. Put them all together, and test.
